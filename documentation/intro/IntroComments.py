# Comments in Python start with the hash character and extend to the end
# of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following
# whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within
# a string literal is just a hash character

spam = 1  # this is also a comment
text = "# this is not a comment because the hash is inside quotes"
