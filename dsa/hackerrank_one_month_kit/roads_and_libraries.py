Determine the minimum cost to provide library access to all citizens of HackerLand.
There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. Currently, there are no libraries and the cities are not connected.
Bidirectional roads may be built between any city pair listed in cities.
A citizen has access to a library if:
- Their city contains a library.
- They can travel by road from their city to a city containing a library.
