"""
There is a numerical sequence known as "Triangular Numbers". The
pattern begins as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and continues onward with the
Nth number in the pattern, which is N plus the previous number.

For example, the 7th number in the sequence is 28, since itâ€™s 7
(which is N) plus 21 (the previous number in the sequence).

Write a function that accepts a number for N and returns the correct number
from the series. That is, if the function was passed the number 7,
the function would return 28.

Triangular Numbers = 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28
input = 7 (the 7th element in the series)
output = 28
